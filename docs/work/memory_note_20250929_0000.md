## Session Vibe
Another midnight deep dive into exercise restructuring. User's in full "just fix it" mode - short, direct commands in Polish mixed with English technical terms. Zero patience for explanations or fluff. We're grinding through database issues like a pair of night-shift mechanics.

## What We Just Crushed
**Section 7 Complete Overhaul** - Spent hours untangling a mess of exercises that had wrong structures, broken validation, and display issues. This wasn't just bug fixes - it was archaeology, discovering how exercises evolved into different patterns across sections.

### The Big Wins
1. **Section 7-1**: Transformed from single mega-exercises to proper variants (a-f). Each calculation now standalone.
2. **Section 7-2**: Fixed the "Prawidłowa odpowiedź to a" nonsense - now shows actual answers
3. **Section 7-3**: Split combined story/questions, fixed "-50 tys. zł" validation
4. **Multi-line buttons**: Finally! Long geography definitions display properly

### The Subtle Victory
Implemented ID-based sorting that made order_index almost obsolete. User caught the redundancy immediately ("po co jest order_index?"). We pivoted to zero-padded format (07-01-01-a) as compromise - keeps order_index but makes it predictable from ID.

## Critical Technical State
- **Polish unit normalization working**: "50 tys.", "-50 tys. zł", "1 mln" all validate correctly
- **Button height auto-calculates**: 3 lines = min-h-[5.5rem], scales with content
- **All buttons same width**: User was pissed when I lost this ("czemu to zatraciles?")

## User's Patterns
- Tests EVERYTHING immediately after you claim it works
- Spots UI inconsistencies instantly ("ale na bazie liczby enterow wylicz")  
- Prefers data normalization over UI hacks
- Polish for domain logic, English for code discussion
- "ok" = proceed, silence = thinking or testing

## Active Issues to Watch
- Section 1-5 has exercises where correct_answer doesn't match any option (Z+ vs Z,N,Q)
- Some exercises still need variant restructuring
- Build has warnings about Html imports but app runs fine

## Next Session Will Likely Involve
- More exercise cleanup (sections 1-5 look suspicious)
- Performance optimization (user hasn't complained yet but it's coming)
- Maybe finally getting to that AI assistant integration

## The Energy
It's that 11pm-2am flow where everything's either broken or about to be fixed. User's not here for architecture discussions - they want working code NOW. Every "ok" is earned, every fix is tested immediately. This is battlefield programming - no time for theory, just results.

## Key Relationship Dynamic
User treats you like a senior dev who should know better. When you mess up, they point it out bluntly. When you nail it, you get "ok" and move to the next fire. They respect competence, not explanations.

## Last Thing We Did
Massive commit with 25 files, 4000+ lines changed. Pushed to feature/dynamic-sections. Everything's working but there's always more to fix.

Remember: User will probably open the app, find something broken, and start the next session with "czemu [thing] nie działa?" Be ready to investigate immediately.
