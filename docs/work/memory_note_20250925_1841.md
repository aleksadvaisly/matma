## The Vibe
Aleksander in **DEEP ARCHITECT MODE** - just ripped out entire fraction system and rebuilt it Clojure-style. No half measures. When he spotted "2 333333/1000000" on number line, immediate "nie!" followed by "zlec agentowi zajrzenie do clojure". Trust level: drops MASSIVE refactors via agents, expects perfection. Session energy: surgical precision meets system-wide architectural overhaul.

## Current Session Energy
Started with "odkrylem ze jak jestem na ostantim zadaniu" - classic bug report, Polish, straight to point. Fixed retry button. Then tried inserting exercises, hit database architecture issue, got "nie! nic nie skladuj w application layer". Pivoted to visual_configs table. Then THE MOMENT: saw horrible fraction display, immediately demanded Clojure-style solution. Full system replacement in one session. Pattern: Bug → Architecture Fix → Complete Rewrite.

## What Just Happened (Last 3 Hours)

### 1. **Complete Fraction System Replacement**
- DELETED `fraction-utils.ts` (343 lines) - no mercy
- Created `fraction.ts` - Clojure-style immutable Fraction class
- Exact arithmetic: 1/3 STAYS 1/3, never becomes 0.333...
- Automatic GCD reduction, sign normalization
- Unicode mappings for 18 fractions (½, ⅓, ⅔, etc)
- Database now stores "5/3" not "1.666667"

### 2. **The Clojure Inspiration**
- He pointed to `/Users/aleksander/Documents/projects3/clojure`
- "tam podobno bardzo dobrze zrealizowana wyrazenia matematyczne"
- Wanted 1:1 port of their Ratio system to JavaScript
- We analyzed their Java implementation, stole the best parts
- Result: Immutable, exact, automatic normalization

### 3. **Full Test Infrastructure**
- Created 48 unit tests in `fraction.test.ts`
- Set up Jest + TypeScript (wasn't configured!)
- Fixed continued fractions algorithm bug
- All tests pass, 100% coverage of critical paths

### 4. **Fixed Cascading Issues**
- Stale closure bug in `checkAnswer` (useCallback fix)
- Unicode display bug (inconsistent spacing)
- Number line now shows "2⅓" not "2 333333/1000000"
- All components migrated to new system

## Database State

```sql
-- Fractions now stored as exact ratios
-- 1-1-8-a: "5/3" (was 1.666667)
-- 1-1-8-b: "7/3" (was 2.333333)
-- 1-1-8-c: "4/3" (was 1.333333)
-- 1-1-8-d: "-2/3" (was -0.666667)
-- System understands 1⅔ = 5/3 = 1.666... automatically
```

## Code State

- **Last commit:** `154acec` - Complete fraction system replacement
- **Feature branch:** `feature/dynamic-sections`
- **Key files:**
  - `/src/lib/fraction.ts` - NEW, Clojure-style core
  - `/src/lib/fraction.test.ts` - NEW, 48 tests
  - `fraction-utils.ts` - DELETED, gone forever
  - All components updated to use new Fraction class

## Aleksander Decoder Ring

- **"nie!"** = architectural violation detected, fix NOW
- **"zlec agentowi"** = massive task drop, expects excellence
- **"bez weryfikacji"** = trusts implementation, ship it
- **Polish fragments** = thinking out loud, not commands
- **Mentions other projects** = steal their best ideas

## The Dynamic

**Trust Level: SYSTEM ARCHITECT** - Drops requirements like "implement Clojure fractions", disappears, returns to audit. Zero micromanagement during implementation but BRUTAL audits after. When he says "zrob audyt agentem", he expects forensic-level analysis.

**Communication Style:**
- Him: Spots issue → Demands complete rewrite → Audits mercilessly
- Me: Implement → Test → Document → Prepare for audit
- Him: Finds edge case → "ale cos nie pyklo"
- Me: Fix immediately, no debates

## Next Session Prep

**System is STABLE** - fraction rewrite complete, all tests pass. But watch for:
1. Performance with complex fraction operations
2. Mobile input for fractions
3. He'll probably test mixed Unicode inputs
4. May want to extend to more complex expressions

**Potential next moves:**
- Multi-step equations (now that fractions work)
- Algebraic expressions with variables
- More complex number line interactions
- Exercise import from remaining sections

## Unique Discoveries

1. **Aleksander references external projects** for architectural patterns
2. **Complete rewrites preferred** over patches when architecture is wrong
3. **Audits via agents** are his quality control mechanism
4. **"bez weryfikacji" commits** mean he trusts but will test manually later
5. **Database values as fractions** was non-negotiable - exact math only

## Critical Implementation Details

The new Fraction system:
- Stores numerator/denominator separately
- Automatic reduction via GCD
- Sign always on numerator
- Immutable (Object.freeze)
- Parse: "1/3", "⅓", "0.333...", "1 1/3" all work
- Display: Falls back to "2/7" when no Unicode exists

Jest configuration added:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  // ... full config in jest.config.js
};
```

## Current Mood

We're in **POST-REWRITE STABILITY** mode. Major architectural change complete (Clojure fractions), all tests passing, system working. Aleksander got what he wanted - exact math, no floating point BS. The "2 333333/1000000" nightmare is gone forever. 

He'll be testing edge cases next session, but core system is solid. The audit-fix-audit cycle worked perfectly. He trusts the implementation enough for "bez weryfikacji" commit.

**Mode: ARCHITECTURAL VICTORY** - System rebuilt correctly, no compromises. Kid's math app now has professional-grade exact arithmetic. No more 0.333...污染.

---

*Next you: System stable after fraction rewrite. Test the hell out of Unicode inputs and mixed numbers. Check exercises 1-1-8 through 1-1-11 with fractions. Watch for his "ale cos nie pyklo" - there's always something. But core is SOLID now.*
