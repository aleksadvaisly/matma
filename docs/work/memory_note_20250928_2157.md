# Memory Note - 2025-09-28 21:57

## Session Vibe & Energy
**Database Detective Mode.** Started with finding holes in Chapter 5 & 6 imports, ended up fixing EVERYTHING. Aleksander's patience is legendary - we went through dozens of database fixes, section title corrections, exercise variant repairs. He's methodical, catches every inconsistency, and tests EVERYTHING in the browser immediately.

## Key Dynamic with Aleksander Today
- **Testing obsession**: Every fix → immediate browser check at localhost:9005
- **Polish precision**: Spots wrong section titles instantly ("to czemu brzmi inaczej!")
- **Pattern recognition master**: "porownaj z innymi zadaniami np. 1.1.1" - always cross-references
- **Direct interrupt style**: [Request interrupted by user] when he sees BS happening
- **Late Saturday night grind**: 22:00 still fixing exercise variants

## What We Actually Fixed (MASSIVE DATABASE SURGERY)

### The Great Title Correction
- Chapter 5 was "Potęgi i pierwiastki" → Fixed to "Odejmowanie liczb całkowitych"
- Chapter 6 was "Zadania praktyczne" → Fixed to "Działania łączone i kolejność wykonywania działań"
- Added missing Chapter 7 "Powtórki i zadania dodatkowe"
- Fixed ALL section titles to match zadania_*.md documents exactly

### Section 5-4 Mystery
- Debug agent messed things up initially
- Section existed in exercises table but NOT in sections table
- Added proper section_components config
- Fixed exercise variants (each had multiple calculations that needed splitting)

### Exercise Validation Enhancement
- User answered "3, 1, -1, -2" but system wanted "A = 3, B = 1, C = -1, D = -2"
- Enhanced Fraction.parse() to extract values after "=" sign
- Added multi-value answer support in Fraction.areEquivalent()
- Now handles equation format: "x = 5" → "5"

### Variant Structure Discovery
Pattern confirmed:
- Main exercise (e.g., 7-1-6) = same content as variant 'a'
- When accessing base ID, shows that exercise
- Random variants only selected via Next button navigation
- Direct URL access = exact exercise (correct behavior for bookmarks)

## Database State Now
- 24 sections total (perfect match with documents)
- All sections have section_components config
- Chapter 7 fully functional with 25 exercises
- Section 5-4 "Dla dociekliwych" has 38 exercises, all variants fixed

## Unique Discoveries
1. **Exercise variants aren't placeholders** - main exercise duplicates variant 'a' intentionally
2. **API returns variants correctly** but randomization happens in frontend navigation
3. **Debug agents can mess up data** - added wrong section titles/configs
4. **Question vs story pattern**: Some exercises use question field, others use story field

## Technical Patterns
```javascript
// Fraction validation now handles:
"A = 3, B = 1" → extracts "3, 1"
"3, 1, -1, -2" = "A = 3, B = 1, C = -1, D = -2" ✓
```

## Current Issues/Mysteries
- Variants always show 'a' when directly accessing base exercise (working as designed?)
- Some exercises have both question AND story fields populated
- Input types 3-5 (number-line, choice-grid, sequence-builder) unused

## Aleksander's Communication Today
- More Polish when frustrated: "co sie stalo z wariantami?"
- Immediate testing: Always has browser open at localhost:9005
- Compares everything: Never trusts single data point
- Interrupts BS quickly: Doesn't let wrong paths continue

## Next Session Priorities
1. Verify all Chapter 1-6 exercises have proper content (not placeholders)
2. Check if variant randomization should work differently
3. Consider implementing number-line input type for appropriate exercises
4. Test the new equation parsing with more exercises

## Mood at Session End
Satisfied but vigilant. Fixed major structural issues but Aleksander knows there are probably more inconsistencies lurking. The "bye" at 21:57 feels like "enough for today" not "we're done." He'll be back to test more edge cases.

## Code State
- npm dev server running on port 9005
- All tests passing including new equation format tests
- Database recently modified (check timestamps)
- Fraction class enhanced with equation parsing

## Last Working Context
Just confirmed exercise variant structure - main exercises intentionally duplicate variant 'a'. This is BY DESIGN, not a bug. Direct URL access shows specific exercise, random selection only happens during navigation.

The mission continues: Perfect database consistency, every exercise working correctly.
