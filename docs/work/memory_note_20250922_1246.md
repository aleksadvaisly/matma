## The Vibe
Aleksander is in **deep debugging mode** - we just spent 30+ minutes tracking down why progress gets stuck at exercise 6 in section 1.1. Subtask tried to help but made things worse. The man is patient but wants WORKING SOFTWARE. Server still running on :9005, progress tracking is mostly functional but has edge cases.

## What Just Happened
**The Exercise 6 Bug Saga** - User discovered that after completing 5 exercises, going to section 1.2, then returning to 1.1, progress resets to exercise 6 and you can't move forward. This is a CRITICAL BUG that blocks his kid's learning.

### Critical Discoveries:
1. **Subtask's "fix" broke things** - Changed `loadProgressFromDatabase` to preserve store state but lost individual exercise completion tracking
2. **Database has wrong count** - Shows 5/8 completed, but can't navigate past exercise 6
3. **I reverted the bad fix** - Restored index-based marking (first N exercises as completed)
4. **Navigation arrows work** - Can go through completed exercises, has pointer cursors
5. **Re-solve works** - Removed auto-feedback for completed exercises

## The Dynamic
Aleksander's pattern: Trusts but VERIFIES. When something breaks at exercise 6, he tests by switching sections to confirm. No rage, just "coś się stało" (something happened). He wants to commit but bugs keep appearing.

Key observations:
- Subtasks can make things worse - need careful review
- User tests EVERYTHING - switching sections, going back/forward
- Wednesday test still looming - this MUST work

## Technical State

### What's Working:
- Navigation arrows with smart logic
- Pointer cursors on all buttons
- Exercise completion updates local store
- Number line centered (finally)
- Re-solving completed exercises

### The Bug:
```javascript
// Problem: Exercise completion by ID vs restoration by INDEX
completeExercise() - marks specific IDs as completed
loadProgressFromDatabase() - marks first N by index
// Result: Mismatch when exercises aren't completed sequentially
```

### Current Database State:
```sql
-- user_progress table shows:
1|default-user|1-1|6|8||
-- 6 of 8 exercises completed (updated manually to test)
```

## Gotchas for Next You

### The Exercise 6 Mystery:
1. Check if exercise IDs match expected format ("I.1.1.6" vs "1-1-6")
2. Verify `canGoNext()` logic - requires current OR next to be completed
3. Test by completing 1-5, switching sections, returning
4. Database vs Store sync is fragile

### Uncommitted Changes:
- `debug_evidence.md` - Subtask's investigation notes
- `test_progress_fix.md` - Testing notes
- Modified `exercise-card.tsx` - Has debug logging
- Need to clean up before committing

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **REMOVE debug files** - Don't commit investigation artifacts
2. **Test the fix thoroughly** - Complete 1-7 exercises, verify navigation
3. **Commit clean changes** - Just the actual fixes
4. **Consider proper fix** - Store exercise IDs completed, not just count

## Aleksander Decoder Ring (Current Session)
- "coś się stało" = something broke, investigate
- "od zadania 6" = the specific breaking point
- Testing pattern = always switches sections to verify persistence
- Wants commits but only with working code

## The Energy
We're in that frustrating space where features work 95% but that 5% blocks everything. The navigation arrows are beautiful, re-solving works great, but exercise 6 is cursed. Aleksander is patient but the Wednesday deadline creates urgency. 

The real issue: **ID-based completion vs INDEX-based restoration**. This architecture flaw will keep causing bugs until properly fixed.

**Server still running on :9005** - exercise 6 bug partially fixed but needs proper testing.

The man's kid needs this working by Wednesday. No pressure.

*Next window: Clean up debug artifacts, test exercise progression thoroughly, commit only working changes. The architecture needs a real fix - store completed exercise IDs, not just counts.*
