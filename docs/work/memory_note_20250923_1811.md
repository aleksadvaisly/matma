# Memory Note - 2025-09-23 18:11

## The Vibe
Aleksander is in **POLISH DAD MODE** - building math app for his 6th grader who has test on Wednesday. We just crushed a MASSIVE refactoring from hardcoded components to 95% database-driven dynamic sections. The man is patient but precise - wants working software NOW, not architectural astronautics.

## Current Session Energy
Started with frustration ("w 2.3.1 chyba treść zadania się zgubiła"), moved through systematic fixes, ended on high note with dynamic button sizing. Classic Aleksander pattern: spot problem → demand fix → test immediately → next problem. Zero drama, maximum efficiency.

## What Just Happened (Last 3 Hours)
1. **Dynamic Sections Audit & Fix** - Agent found navigation still hardcoded, we made it FULLY database-driven
2. **Story/Question Split Bug** - Section 2.3 word problems lost context, fixed by showing both `story` AND `question`
3. **Option Value vs Display** - Implemented dual system: "5°C" displayed, "5" compared, feedback shows "5°C"
4. **Dynamic Button Widths** - Buttons now size to longest option text, all same width in set
5. **Missing Options Crisis** - Section 1-2 lost all comparison options except "<", restored "<", "=", ">"
6. **CurrentExercise Undefined** - Added guard for page refresh edge case

## The Dynamic
- **Testing Pattern**: Makes change → immediately curls API → spots issue → "o co chodzi?" → fix
- **Language Mix**: Polish when frustrated ("niestety"), English for tech stuff
- **Trust Level**: HIGH - delegates to agents but ALWAYS verifies ("zlec audyt")
- **Priorities**: Child's Wednesday test > Perfect code

## Database State
```sql
-- Key additions today:
- layout_type column (horizontal/vertical/NULL for auto)
- option_value column (compare value vs display text)
- next_section_id, next_chapter_id for navigation
```

## Critical Fixes Applied
1. **Sections with proper units**:
   - 2-3-1: Temperature (°C)
   - 2-3-2: Diving depth (m) NOT floors!
   - 2-3-3: Money (zł) - horizontal layout
   - 2-3-5: Elevator floors (piętro) NOT temperature!

2. **Layout Rules**:
   - ≤6 chars = horizontal auto
   - Explicit overrides in DB
   - Dynamic button widths based on longest text

## Gotchas for Next You
1. **NEVER claim 95% database-driven** unless it's TRUE (navigation was still hardcoded)
2. **Word problems need BOTH** `story` (context) AND `question` fields
3. **Option display ≠ comparison** - always separate text from value
4. **CurrentExercise can be undefined** on refresh - always guard
5. **Duplicate removal can be TOO aggressive** - we lost valid options in 1-2

## Current Server State
- Running on :9005 (probably still up)
- All 22 sections configured
- Dynamic sections working
- Navigation fully from database

## What's Next (Implicit)
- Child has test WEDNESDAY (3 days)
- Chapters 3-6 need exercises
- All structure ready, just needs content
- System is stable for content entry

## Aleksander Decoder (Current Session)
- "zlec agentowi" = delegate to agent
- "o co chodzi?" = WTF just happened
- "niestety" = minor annoyance, fix it
- Short responses = he's testing/verifying
- Mixing Polish/English = in the zone

## The Energy Right Now
We're in PRODUCTIVE FLOW. No major architecture debates, just rapid fixes. Aleksander knows exactly what he wants, I execute precisely. The Wednesday test deadline creates urgency without panic. System is finally stable after dynamic sections overhaul.

**Mode: EXECUTION** - Not planning, not discussing, just fixing and shipping.

**Trust Level: MAXIMUM** - He's letting me make changes without detailed review because stuff is working.

The man's kid needs to pass math. We're making it happen.
