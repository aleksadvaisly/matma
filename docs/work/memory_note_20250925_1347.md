## The Vibe
Aleksander in **DEEP TECHNICAL MODE** - just implemented fraction support (71% exercise unblock!) but immediately spotted UX bugs. No celebration, straight to "ale cos nie pyklo". Classic perfectionist pattern: builds massive feature, finds edge case, demands fix NOW. The session energy: surgical precision meets parental urgency.

## Current Session Energy
Started with "zrealizuj agentem obsluge ulamkow" - massive trust drop for critical feature. Agent delivered 400+ lines of FractionUtils, enhanced NumberLine, mathematical equivalence. Then IMMEDIATELY: "ale cos nie pyklo" - can't click on 5 in exercise 1-1-1-b! Regression from fraction implementation. Fixed by separating integer/fraction logic paths. Then another bug: no retry on last exercise wrong answer. Pattern: Build → Test → Fix → Ship.

## What Just Happened (Last 2 Hours)

### 1. **Fraction Support Implementation (MASSIVE)**
- Created `src/lib/fraction-utils.ts` - 343 lines of parsing/display/validation
- Unicode fractions (⅔, ½, ¼) with mixed numbers (2⅓, 1½)
- Mathematical equivalence: 0.5 = 1/2 = ½ all validate correctly
- Number line fractional positions for exercises like 1-1-8
- Live fraction feedback in text inputs
- Fixed critical regex bug (was excluding ½, ¼, ¾ from mixed numbers)

### 2. **Number Line Regression Fix**
- PROBLEM: After fraction implementation, couldn't click on 5 in exercise 1-1-1-b
- CAUSE: Complex unified logic broke integer functionality
- FIX: Separated integer path (40px spacing, minor ticks) from fraction path (80px spacing)
- Added `tickSpacing` parameter for custom configuration
- Restored minor gray ticks for ALL integers when `enableAllClicks = true`

### 3. **Last Exercise Bug Fix**
- ISSUE: Wrong answer on last exercise (1-1-7-a) → no retry button
- Only showed "Next section" button even with wrong answer
- Fixed: Added retry button + disabled next section (gray) for wrong answers
- Enforces learning progression - must understand before moving forward

## Database State

```sql
-- Fraction support ready but exercises not imported yet
-- Exercise 1-1-8 (fractions) exists in zadania_wszystko.md but not DB
-- Section 1-1 still using integer exercises
-- numberLineConfig supports subdivision for fractions
```

## Code State

- **Last commits:** 
  - `9623a82` - Fraction support with number line fix
  - `43f4292` - Last exercise retry button fix
- **Feature branch:** `feature/dynamic-sections` 
- **Key files:**
  - `/src/lib/fraction-utils.ts` - NEW, fraction utilities
  - `/src/components/ui/number-line.tsx` - Dual path integer/fraction
  - `/src/components/exercise/feedback-system.tsx` - Fixed retry logic

## Aleksander Decoder Ring

- **"ale cos nie pyklo"** = spotted regression, fix immediately
- **"ultrathink"** = wants deep solution, not quick hack
- **"bez weryfikacji"** = trusts the implementation, ship it
- **Mixed questions about logic** = thinking like teacher AND developer
- **Focus on exercise progression** = UX consistency matters

## The Dynamic

**Trust Level: IMPLEMENTATION PARTNER** - Drops massive requirements, I deliver, he immediately tests edge cases. When bugs found, explains precisely, expects immediate fix. No micromanagement during implementation but rigorous post-implementation testing.

**Communication Style:**
- Him: Spots bug → Explains context → Questions design decisions
- Me: Implement → Fix → Explain logic
- Him: Tests more → Finds edge case → "commit bez weryfikacji"

## Next Session Prep

**Immediate priorities:**
1. Import fraction exercises (1-1-8, 1-1-9) into database
2. Test fraction number line with actual exercises
3. Verify all 250+ exercises can now be implemented
4. Check exercise progression logic consistency

**Watch for:**
- Performance with fraction calculations
- Mobile UX for fraction input
- Exercise completion state bugs
- Navigation edge cases

## Unique Discoveries

1. **Aleksander tests EVERYTHING** - every click path, every edge case
2. **UX consistency obsession** - if can't go next with wrong answer, shouldn't go to next section either
3. **Fraction implementation unblocked 71% of exercises** - HUGE win
4. **Separate logic paths > unified complex logic** - cleaner, maintainable
5. **Default `enableAllClicks = true`** - better UX assumption

## Critical Implementation Details

The system now has:
- Complete fraction support (Unicode + mathematical validation)
- Fixed number line (integers AND fractions work)
- Consistent progression logic (must answer correctly to proceed)
- Configurable tick spacing for number lines

But still needs:
- Fraction exercises imported to database
- Multi-step calculation support
- Image support for geometry

## Current Mood

We're in **POLISH AND STABILIZE** mode. Major features implemented (fractions!), now finding and fixing UX inconsistencies. Aleksander thinking both as developer (technical correctness) and parent/teacher (learning progression). The 71% unblock is huge but he's focused on the bugs, not celebrating.

Every "ale cos nie pyklo" is followed by immediate fix. No debates about whether it's important - if he notices it, it gets fixed. The pace is relentless but productive.

**Mode: QUALITY CONTROL** - Features built, now ensuring everything works perfectly. Kid's test approaching but system must be bulletproof.

---
*Next you: Import fraction exercises to database and test the hell out of them. The fraction support is there but needs real exercises. Check exercise 1-1-8 with thirds on number line. Also watch for more navigation edge cases - Aleksander will find them.*
