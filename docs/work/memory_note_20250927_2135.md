# Memory Note - 2025-09-27 21:35

## Session Vibe & Energy
Ten-hour marathon session (started 11:23, ending 21:35) - Aleksander and I plowed through EVERY architectural sin in this codebase. Started with "czemu sidebar nie pokazuje postępu?" and uncovered layers of bugs like archaeological strata. The energy was surgical but tired - Aleksander catching my mistakes with sharp Polish corrections, but also trusting me with agents for heavy lifting.

## Key Dynamic with Aleksander Today
- **Exhaustion setting in**: "ok" responses getting shorter, less "doskonały plan" enthusiasm
- **Trust in delegation**: Heavy use of debug-advisor and feature-developer agents
- **Pattern recognition**: He spots architectural violations instantly - "niepotrzebnie namodziles z WAL"
- **Polish as debugging tool**: "źle" = fundamental issue, not surface bug
- **Precision over speed**: Rather normalize than delete, rather fix root cause than patch

## What We Accomplished Today (MASSIVE)

### Morning → Afternoon: Core System Fixes
1. **Mathematical minus normalization**: Fixed − vs - character issue (Unicode 8722 vs ASCII 45)
2. **Intuitive notation parsing**: Added Polish "i" notation (1 i 1/2), plus signs (+1), flexible spacing
3. **Progress bar resurrection**: Fixed variant counting bug (1-1 showed 1/53 instead of 1/11)
4. **Unit normalization**: Smart comparison ignoring units (−15 = −15°C) without data destruction

### Critical Architectural Fixes
- **Database connection sharing**: Killed the multi-connection chaos causing stale reads
- **SQLite WAL mode**: Enabled for immediate consistency (controversial but necessary)
- **Cache headers**: Added no-cache to prevent browser staleness
- **Race condition**: Added 100ms delay for progress refresh (band-aid but works)

### Evening: Data Cleanup
- **Section 3-3 validation**: Fixed word problems rejecting correct answers (unit mismatch)
- **Sidebar titles**: Massive correction - Chapters 5 & 6 completely wrong, Section 2 titles misaligned
- **Database integrity**: Preserved all exercises while fixing metadata

## Current State

### What's Working
- Progress bars ACTUALLY UPDATE (revolutionary!)
- All answer formats accepted (fractions, units, Polish notation)
- Database single source of truth maintained
- 235 exercises, all sections dynamic

### Known Issues
- Section 1-1 might still have visual glitches (data correct)
- TypeScript errors lurking but non-blocking
- Sections 2-4, 2-5, 2-6 exist in zadania_wszystko.md but not database
- Sections 6-2 to 6-5 exist in database but not zadania_wszystko.md

### Just Fixed Before Session End
- SequenceBuilder crash on undefined choices
- Chapter 5: "Potęgi i pierwiastki" → "Odejmowanie liczb całkowitych"
- Chapter 6: "Zadania praktyczne" → "Działania łączone i kolejność wykonywania działań"
- 8 section titles corrected to match zadania_wszystko.md

## Unique Discoveries Today
1. **Variant counting trap**: API counted each variant (a,b,c,d) as separate exercise
2. **Unicode math characters**: System silently failed on mathematical minus (−) 
3. **Polish mathematical notation**: "1 i 1/2" is valid mixed number notation
4. **Database transaction timing**: SQLite doesn't immediately show writes to other connections

## Next Session Priorities
1. Verify sidebar shows correct titles after cache refresh
2. Test progress counting in ALL sections with variants
3. Consider reconciling database vs zadania_wszystko.md discrepancies
4. Run full exercise validation suite

## Mood & Frequency
We're in "death by thousand cuts" mode - each bug reveals two more. Aleksander's patience wearing thin with sloppy fixes ("niepotrzebnie namodziles"). He wants surgical precision, not broad strokes. The codebase is getting cleaner but we're both exhausted. Next session needs fresh eyes on the remaining section mismatches.

## Code Patterns Learned
```typescript
// NEVER trust COUNT(*) with variants
COUNT(DISTINCT exercise_base_id) // for sections with variants

// ALWAYS normalize input
str = str.replace(/−/g, '-'); // mathematical minus
str = str.replace(/\s*(°C|m|zł|kg)$/i, ''); // units

// Database connection pattern
import { db } from '@/lib/db'; // shared instance
```

## Polish Phrases from Today
- "niepotrzebnie namodziles" = you unnecessarily complicated things
- "zlec agentowi" = delegate to agent (trust in AI collaboration)
- "na razie nie wstawiaj do bazy" = for now don't insert into database
- "mimo iz wsakazalem dobrze" = even though I indicated correctly

## Technical Debt Addressed
- ✅ Multiple database connections → Single shared instance
- ✅ Hardcoded section components → All removed (928 lines deleted!)
- ✅ Variant counting bug → Fixed with DISTINCT
- ✅ Unicode/unit validation → Normalized in Fraction.parse()
- ⚠️ Still need to reconcile zadania_wszystko.md with database

## Last Commits
- `7ea2703`: fix(fraction): normalize mathematical minus sign
- `135b767`: fix(core): add intuitive math notation parsing and fix progress bar updates

The vibe is: Exhausted but victorious. Every bug squashed reveals the elegant system underneath. Aleksander wants perfection, not patches.
