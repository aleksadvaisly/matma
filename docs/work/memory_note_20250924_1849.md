## The Vibe
Aleksander is in **BUILDER MODE** - just implemented a slick variant system for exercises. No fluff, pure execution. We went from "każde zadanie ma być losowane" to full implementation in under 30 minutes. The man knows what he wants, I deliver precisely. Zero architecture astronautics, maximum pragmatism.

## Current Session Energy
Started with database bug fix (NaN answers - wrong answerType config), moved through systematic variant implementation, ended with UI polish (minor tick marks on number line). Classic Aleksander flow: spot issue → define minimal solution → execute → next. Language mix shows engagement - Polish when thinking out loud, English for technical precision.

## What Just Happened (Last Hour)

### 1. **NaN Answer Bug Fix**
- Section 1-2 had `answerType: "integer"` but answers were `<`, `=`, `>`
- `parseInt("<")` = NaN → broke feedback
- Fixed by changing answerType to "choice" for comparison sections
- Also fixed 1-5 (text for sets) and 2-3 (text for units)

### 2. **Variant System Implementation** 
**HIS IDEA:** "każdy z podrozdziałów np. 1.1 ma mieć warianty a) b) c)... losowane z bazy"

**MY COUNTER:** "Create new table exercise_variants?"

**HIS WISDOM:** "nie możesz użyć istniejących struktur? po prostu zmigraj"

**RESULT:** Minimal risk approach using existing tables:
```sql
ALTER TABLE exercises ADD COLUMN variant_letter CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'a';
ALTER TABLE exercises ADD COLUMN exercise_base_id TEXT;
```

### 3. **Implementation Details**
- Changed IDs: `1-1-1` → `1-1-1-a`, `1-1-1-b`, `1-1-1-c`, `1-1-1-d`
- Each exercise has 4 variants with different values
- API randomly selects one variant per exercise
- Added variant prefix to questions: "B) Która liczba znajduje się 5 jednostek..."
- **28 total exercises** in section 1-1 (7 base × 4 variants)

### 4. **Number Line UI Enhancement**
- Problem: "oś ma zaznaczone jednostki co 2, powinny być jednostki pomiędzy"
- Solution: Added minor tick marks (gray, thin) between major ticks
- Now all units visible and clickable for precise selection

## Database State

```sql
-- Variant system active for section 1-1
-- Each exercise has variant_letter and exercise_base_id
-- Example: exercise 1-1-1 has variants a,b,c,d with different values

SELECT exercise_base_id, COUNT(*) FROM exercises 
WHERE section_id = '1-1' GROUP BY exercise_base_id;
-- Returns: 7 exercises × 4 variants each
```

## Code Changes Today

1. **src/lib/db.ts**: Modified `getExercisesBySection()` to randomly select variants
2. **src/components/ui/number-line.tsx**: Added minor tick marks
3. **matma.db**: Added variant columns, generated 21 new exercise variants

## Current Technical State

- Server running on :9005 
- Feature branch: `feature/dynamic-sections`
- Last commits: database fixes and variant system
- **System stable** - variant randomization working perfectly

## Aleksander Decoder Ring

- **"bez weryfikacji"** = skip verification, just commit
- **"możesz sobie wziąć stare matma.db"** = compare but don't overwrite!
- **"jak to widzisz?"** = wants your approach but will correct if wrong
- **Short "ok" responses** = he's testing/verifying your work
- **Polish technical descriptions** = he's visualizing the solution

## The Dynamic

**Trust Level: MAXIMUM** - He's letting me modify core database structure because I deliver working solutions. No long explanations needed, just show it works.

**Communication Style:**
- Him: Describes problem in Polish with technical English terms mixed in
- Me: Propose solution briefly, implement fast
- Him: Tests immediately, spots issues instantly
- Cycle repeats until perfect

## Next Session Prep

**Likely next tasks:**
1. Add variants to remaining sections (1-2 through 2-3)
2. Track which variant student attempted (for analytics)
3. Ensure variant consistency in retry scenarios

**Watch for:**
- More UI refinements (he spots UX issues quickly)
- Performance with many variants
- Test results Wednesday (kid's math test driving urgency)

## Unique Discoveries

1. **Aleksander prefers extending existing structures over creating new ones** - minimizes risk
2. **Visual feedback crucial** - immediately noticed number line needed minor ticks
3. **Variant letters shown in questions** - transparency about which variant was selected
4. **RANDOM() in SQLite works great** for variant selection

## Current Mood

We're in **FLOW STATE**. Quick decisions, fast implementation, immediate testing. Aleksander knows his kid needs this for Wednesday's test, I'm helping make it happen. No debates about perfect architecture - just working software that helps a 6th grader learn math.

The man said "dodaj warianty" at 18:20, by 18:45 we had 28 working exercise variants with random selection. That's the energy here.

**Mode: SHIP IT** - Features landing fast, database solid, UI improving incrementally.

*Next you: Just run `curl -s "http://localhost:9005/api/exercises/1-1" | jq` a few times to see the variant randomization in action. It's beautiful.*
