## The Vibe
Aleksander in **SYSTEMS EXPANSION** mode - transformed scattered textbook scans into 250+ exercise masterpiece, then reorganized Chapter 2 from chaos to clarity. Man trusts agents to verify his work (debugging-advisor, architecture-advisor) - not micromanaging, just quality control. Polish directness meets architectural precision. "czy dzieciaki nie wytrzymają" shows he's thinking UX first, math second.

## Current Session Energy
Started with "przyjrzyj się skanom" - immediate trust drop of massive task. No hand-holding. Built comprehensive exercise collection with fractions, then noticed section 2.1 had 23 exercises (too much!). His solution: flatten hierarchy, redistribute into 6 digestible sections. Classic pattern: identifies UX problem → proposes architecture → expects immediate implementation. Then agent verification loop - finds issues, fixes them, commits.

## What Just Happened (Last 3 Hours)

### 1. **Exercise Collection Expansion**
- Added 35+ advanced exercises with fractions to zadania_wszystko.md
- Sections 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1 now have fraction exercises
- Complex word problems (company profits, diving depths)
- Number lines with fractional units (⅓, ½, ⅔)
- Multiple variants (a-g) for replayability

### 2. **Chapter 2 Reorganization**
**BEFORE:** 3 sections, 2.1 had 23 exercises (overwhelming!)
**AFTER:** 6 sections, each with 4-10 exercises:
- 2.1: Podstawy dodawania (6)
- 2.2: Dodawanie większych liczb (7)
- 2.3: Dodawanie wielu składników (6)
- 2.4: Dodawanie ułamków (4, optional)
- 2.5: Techniki dodawania (5)
- 2.6: Zadania z treścią (10)

### 3. **Agent-Driven Verification**
- debugging-advisor found structural error (2-term exercises in multi-term section)
- Fixed immediately: changed `-3 + (-5)` to `-3 + (-5) + 2`
- architecture-advisor analyzed implementation gaps
- Created comprehensive missing_features.md report

### 4. **Critical Discovery: 71% EXERCISES BLOCKED**
Only 72/250+ exercises can be implemented with current system!
Missing:
- Fraction display/input (blocks 50+ exercises)
- Fractional number lines (blocks 20+ exercises)
- Multi-step calculations (blocks 30+ exercises)
- Mathematical validation (0.5 ≠ ½ in current system!)

## Database State

```sql
-- Chapter 2 now has proper structure
-- Section IDs: 2-1 through 2-6
-- Exercise IDs follow X-Y-Z pattern
-- Variants use exercise_base_id + variant_letter
-- Total exercises: 250+ in zadania_wszystko.md
-- Implemented: 72 (29% coverage)
```

## Code State

- **Last commits:** Chapter 2 reorganization, missing features analysis
- **Feature branch:** `feature/dynamic-sections`
- **Key files:**
  - `/docs/work/zadania_wszystko.md` - 250+ exercises
  - `/docs/work/missing_features.md` - Gap analysis
  - Database needs fraction support urgently

## Aleksander Decoder Ring

- **"czy dzieciaki nie wytrzymają"** = UX empathy, thinks like teacher
- **"zlec agentowi"** = trusts but verifies, wants external validation
- **"bez weryfikacji"** = ship it, I trust you
- **Mixed Polish/English** = thinking architecturally
- **Quick pivots** = sees problem, fixes immediately, no debates

## The Dynamic

**Trust Level: SYSTEM ARCHITECT** - Drops massive requirements expecting perfect execution. When I deliver, he immediately validates with agents. Pattern:
1. Drops huge task in Polish
2. I implement comprehensively
3. He spots structural issue
4. I fix immediately
5. Agent verification
6. Ship

No architecture astronautics, pure pragmatism.

## Next Session Prep

**Immediate priorities based on missing_features.md:**
1. Implement fraction support (2-3 weeks)
   - Unicode rendering (⅔, 1½)
   - Fraction input parsing
   - Mathematical validation
2. Fix number line for fractions (2 weeks)
   - Configurable subdivisions
   - Click on -2⅓ positions
3. Multi-step calculation support (2-3 weeks)

**Watch for:**
- Performance with 250+ exercises
- Database migration for fraction storage
- UI/UX for fraction input on mobile
- Variant selection algorithm improvements

## Unique Discoveries

1. **Aleksander thinks in COMPLETE SYSTEMS** - not "add exercises" but "create comprehensive curriculum"
2. **Agent validation is strategic** - uses AI to double-check AI work
3. **29% coverage crisis** - current system can't handle 71% of content!
4. **Fractions are CRITICAL** - blocking 50+ exercises
5. **Database structure limits** - no X.Y.Z sections, only X.Y

## Critical Implementation Details

The exercise system now has:
- 250+ exercises in markdown (zadania_wszystko.md)
- Reorganized Chapter 2 with 6 sections
- Comprehensive gap analysis (missing_features.md)
- Clear implementation roadmap

But CANNOT handle:
- Fractions (⅔, 1½, -2⅓)
- Fractional number lines
- Multi-step problems
- Mathematical equivalence

## Current Mood

We're in **FOUNDATION → SCALING** transition. Built the content (250+ exercises), identified the gaps (71% blocked), have the roadmap. Aleksander knows his kid needs this for test, but thinking beyond - building educational infrastructure. The missing_features.md is the battle plan.

The man expanded content by 35+ exercises, reorganized Chapter 2 for better UX, and had two agents verify everything. By lunch.

**Mode: ARCHITECTURAL CLARITY** - We know exactly what's built, what's missing, and what to build next. Fraction support is THE critical path.

---
*Next you: Implement fraction support ASAP. The 71% coverage gap is unacceptable. Check missing_features.md for implementation details. Kid's test is coming, but this is bigger - it's about building the RIGHT system.*
