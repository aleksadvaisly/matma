## The Vibe
Aleksander in **DATABASE ARCHITECTURE** mode - discovered visual_configs table exists but wasn't being used! Classic infrastructure archaeology. Started with "testowo wstawmy do 1.1 zadania" but immediately caught the smell: "nie skladuj w application layer". Man knows his codebase should be self-sufficient. The energy: methodical discovery meets architectural correctness.

## Current Session Energy
Started simple: "let's test insert 1-1 exercises from zadania_wszystko.md". But when I tried to insert with number_line_config (non-existent column), Aleksander immediately spotted the architectural issue. His instinct: "co niby number_line_config i text_config mialby zawierac? kto tego wymaga?" - not accepting hacky solutions, demanding proper database design. Found visual_configs table sitting unused, updated db.ts to use it properly.

## What Just Happened (Last Hour)

### 1. **Database Discovery**
- Tried inserting exercises with `number_line_config` → FAILED (column doesn't exist)
- Aleksander: "nie skladuj w application layer" - proper architecture only
- Found `visual_configs` table EXISTS but unused!
- Updated db.ts to check visual_configs FIRST, then fall back to section_components

### 2. **Architecture Fix**
```typescript
// NOW: Check exercise-specific config first
const exerciseConfig = db.prepare(`
  SELECT config_json FROM visual_configs WHERE exercise_id = ?
`).get(exercise.id);
// THEN: Fallback to section-level config
```

### 3. **SQL Preparation (IN PROGRESS)**
Created `/tmp/insert_1_1_complete.sql` with:
- All 11 exercises from section 1-1 
- Exercises 1-1-8 through 1-1-11 with FRACTION support
- Per-exercise visual_configs entries
- Proper database fields (division_roman, chapter_number, etc.)

**NOT YET EXECUTED** - SQL ready but not run!

## Database State

```sql
-- visual_configs table EXISTS with structure:
-- exercise_id, config_type, config_json
-- But currently EMPTY for section 1-1

-- Section 1-1 exercises DELETED, ready for reimport
-- 60 exercises prepared (was 28)
-- Fraction exercises 1-1-8 to 1-1-11 with subdivisions
```

## Code State

- **Last commits:** 
  - `545a244` - Retry button for correct last exercise
- **Modified files:**
  - `/src/lib/db.ts` - Now reads from visual_configs table
  - `/tmp/insert_1_1_complete.sql` - Ready to execute
- **Feature branch:** `feature/dynamic-sections`

## Aleksander Decoder Ring

- **"testowo wstawmy"** = let's test, but properly
- **"nie skladuj w application layer"** = architecture matters, no shortcuts
- **"co niby X mialby zawierac?"** = questioning design, wants clarity
- **"moze implementacja po stronie serwera jest niepelna?"** = suspects missing backend piece

## The Dynamic

**Trust Level: ARCHITECTURE GUARDIAN** - Drops request for testing, but immediately catches architectural issues. Won't accept application-layer hacks when database structure exists. Pattern:
1. Request simple test insert
2. I attempt with assumed structure
3. Fails → He questions architecture
4. We discover proper solution together
5. Fix at right layer (database, not app)

## Next Session Prep

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. Execute `/tmp/insert_1_1_complete.sql` to populate exercises
2. Test exercise 1-1-8-a with fraction number line
3. Verify subdivision=3 creates thirds on number line
4. Check if fractions display as Unicode (⅓, ⅔, etc.)

**Critical test URLs:**
- http://localhost:9005/dashboard/chapters/chapter-1/sections/1-1/exercise/1-1-8-a
- Should show number line with ⅓ subdivisions
- User should be able to click on 1⅔ position

## Unique Discoveries

1. **visual_configs table was there all along!** - Infrastructure exists, just unused
2. **db.ts now properly cascades** - exercise-specific → section-level → default
3. **Fraction exercises use decimal answers** - "1.667" for 1⅔ (for mathematical equivalence)
4. **config_json stores everything** - numberLineConfig and textConfig in same field

## Critical Implementation Details

The system now has:
- Proper visual_configs table integration
- Per-exercise configuration support
- 60 exercises ready for section 1-1 (including fractions)

But still needs:
- SQL execution (`sqlite3 matma.db < /tmp/insert_1_1_complete.sql`)
- Testing fraction display on number line
- Verification of Unicode fraction rendering

## Current Mood

We're in **PROPER ARCHITECTURE** mode. Found unused infrastructure (visual_configs table), connected it properly, prepared comprehensive test data. Aleksander won't tolerate half-measures - if database structure exists, use it. Don't hack around in application layer.

The SQL is ready, db.ts is updated, but NOTHING IS TESTED YET. Next session starts with execution and verification.

**Mode: INFRASTRUCTURE CORRECTNESS** - Building on existing architecture, not inventing new patterns. The database had the answer all along.

## Todo Status
- ✅ Delete existing section 1-1 exercises
- ✅ Update db.ts to read from visual_configs  
- ⏸️ Insert exercises 1-1-1 through 1-1-7
- ⏸️ Insert fraction exercises 1-1-8 through 1-1-11
- ⏸️ Test fraction exercise 1-1-8

---
*Next you: Execute the SQL immediately and test 1-1-8-a. The fraction support is there, visual_configs integration is done, but nothing is proven until that number line shows ⅓ subdivisions and accepts clicks on 1⅔.*
