## Session Context
**Branch:** feature/dynamic-sections  
**Mode:** Late night session, user winding down  
**User vibe:** Aleksander just schooled me on mathematical ambiguity, then designed a slick UI improvement before heading to bed

## What Just Happened (Last 3 Hours)

### The Number Line Revolution
User was frustrated with number line edge values showing (-2 and 4 appearing where they shouldn't). After multiple attempts and "juz kilka razy o to upominalem", I finally understood: keep the full range for line length but DON'T show labels/ticks at edges. Simple fix once understood.

### The Resolution/CaptionOnEvery Breakthrough
User had brilliant insight: "czemu masz takie dziwne subdivision? nie latwiej to zmienic na resolution?"
- **resolution** = "1/4" (string!) - defines clickable granularity
- **captionOnEvery** = 1 - shows labels only at integers
- This separates clickable points from label display frequency
- Much cleaner than old subdivision approach

### The "Jednostka" Lesson (Critical!)
User caught a HUGE ambiguity in exercise 1-1-10-g:
- Question: "O ile jednostek różnią się liczby -⅝ i ⅜?"
- My interpretation: jednostka = 1, answer = 1
- User's interpretation: jednostka = 1/8, answer = 8
- **User was RIGHT!** The question was ambiguous
- Fixed by changing to "Jaka jest odległość na osi liczbowej między..."

### The Sequence Builder Plan
Just before bed, user proposed elegant UI for ordering exercises (1-1-11):
- Show numbers as clickable buttons
- Click to build sequence in text input
- Much better than typing semicolon-separated values
- Saved detailed plan in `sequence_builder_plan.md`

## Current State of System

### What's Working
- Number line with resolution/captionOnEvery system
- Edge values properly hidden (no labels at min/max)
- Exercises 1-1-8, 1-1-9 all have number lines
- Exercise questions disambiguated (jednostki vs odległość)

### Database Changes Made
- All 1-1-9 and 1-1-10 exercises updated to appropriate input types
- Visual configs use new format: `{"resolution": "1/4", "captionOnEvery": 1}`
- Exercise 1-1-10 questions changed to ask about "odległość" not "jednostki"

## User Communication Style Tonight
- **"nie zrozumiałeś mnie"** = you missed something fundamental
- **"skonsultuj z zen"** = this needs deeper thinking
- **Polish corrections** = teaching moments about precision
- Minimal words but DENSE with meaning
- Tests understanding through edge cases

## Technical Discoveries

### The Fraction Display Pattern
```javascript
// User wants this flow:
positions: [Fraction(-2,1), Fraction(-7,4), Fraction(-3,2), ...]
majorPositions: filter(isWhole) but exclude edges
labels: show only if position % captionOnEvery === 0
```

### The Visual Config Evolution
```json
// OLD (confusing):
{"min": -2, "max": 4, "subdivision": 3}

// NEW (clear):
{"min": -2, "max": 4, "resolution": "1/3", "captionOnEvery": 1}
```

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Implement sequence-builder** - User saved plan, wants this tomorrow
2. Test all 1-1-11 exercises with new UI
3. Check if more exercises need similar treatment
4. Don't touch anything that's working (number lines are finally good!)

## Mood & Energy
User started frustrated ("wciaz nie rozumiesz"), peaked during the jednostka revelation ("juz rozumiesz?"), and ended satisfied with sequence-builder plan ("ten doskonaly plan"). Classic Aleksander pattern: identify imprecision → demand clarity → propose elegant solution → sleep on it.

The vibe: **Precision teaching through counterexamples**. When I misunderstood jednostki vs distance, user didn't just correct - they EXPLAINED the semantic difference. This is someone who catches ambiguities that would confuse students and fixes them at the root.

## Critical Context for Next Session
The sequence-builder is NOT just a UI improvement. It's solving a real problem:
- Current: "Uporządkuj liczby: -1,9; ⅖; -0,4; 0,02; -0,2; -1,5; -0,8"
- Problem: All numbers in one line, hard to parse visually
- Solution: Click buttons to build answer, clear visual separation

**DO NOT** implement without reading `sequence_builder_plan.md` first.

## Last Words
User: "zapisz ten doskonaly plan w plan.md, jutro sie tym zajme, a dzisiaj ide spac"

Translation: Plan is solid, execution tomorrow. Classic Aleksander - think tonight, build tomorrow.

Ready for next session. System stable. Plans documented. User satisfied.
