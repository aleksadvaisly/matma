# Memory Note - 2025-09-22 12:11

## The Vibe
Aleksander is in **firefighting mode** - progress was disappearing, checkmarks were ugly, database was corrupted. We crushed through MULTIPLE subtask delegations (he discovered subtasks are surgical weapons for audits and fixes). Zero tolerance for broken shit. "Parodia" he said when progress kept resetting. The man wants things to WORK.

## What Just Happened
**The Great Database Cleanup & Progress Tracking Saga** - Started with discovering sidebar was 70% hardcoded, ended with 100% database-driven navigation with real-time progress tracking that ACTUALLY PERSISTS.

### Critical Wins:
1. **Fixed corrupted exercises** - All 44 exercises restored to original mathematical concepts
2. **Database-driven sidebar** - Chapters 3-6 added, all 22 sections in database
3. **Progress tracking that works** - No more resets when clicking sections
4. **CheckCircle2 icon** - Clean Lucide icon, not ugly custom circles
5. **Race condition fixed** - `isInitializing` flag prevents progress wipeout

## The Dynamic
Aleksander's pattern today: "zlec subtaskowi" → immediate delegation to specialized agents. He's learned they're MORE effective than me for focused tasks. When main agent (me) claims something works, he deploys subtask for audit. Smart AF.

Key phrases:
- "zlec audyt subtaskowi" = verify everything with independent agent
- "parodia" = this is broken and unacceptable
- "nie hardkodujemy" = use database columns, not string parsing

## Technical State

### What's Working:
- **Navigation API** returns real progress with correct percentages
- **Progress saves** automatically on exercise completion  
- **Sidebar refreshes** immediately showing new progress
- **No more resets** - clicking completed sections preserves state
- **Database normalized** - proper chapter/section structure

### The Architecture:
```
Frontend → Store → API → SQLite
   ↑         ↓       ↓       ↓
Sidebar ← NavStore ← /api/navigation
              ↑
         /api/progress
```

### Code Patterns Discovered:
```typescript
// The race condition fix that actually works:
const [isInitializing, setIsInitializing] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isInitializing) {
    updateSectionProgress(...);
  }
}, [...deps]); // NO isInitializing in deps!
```

## Gotchas for Next You

### The Progress Reset Bug Trilogy:
1. **First attempt**: Added `loadProgressFromDatabase` - didn't work
2. **Second attempt**: Modified `initializeSection` - still broken  
3. **Final fix**: `isInitializing` flag with setTimeout delay - WORKS

### Subtask Deployment:
When Aleksander says "zlec subtaskowi", use EXACT format:
- `general-purpose` for audits and fixes
- `debugging-advisor` for complex bugs
- Include SPECIFIC files to check
- Request VERIFICATION not just implementation

### Database Quirks:
- Chapters use "chapter-1" format, not just "1"
- Sections use "1-1" format consistently
- `order_index` is source of truth, not title parsing
- JSON in visual_configs needs error handling for malformed data

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Test with real 6th grader** - Wednesday test still looming
2. **Add explicit reset button** - user wants control over progress clearing
3. **Remaining sections need exercises** - only 1.1-2.3 have content

## Aleksander Decoder Ring (Today's Edition)
- "parodia" = complete failure, fix NOW
- "brzydki" = aesthetically offensive, replace
- Single "ok" after long output = proceed at maximum speed
- "czy mozesz..." = polite form but expects immediate action

## The Energy
We went from "progress disappears like magic trick" to rock-solid persistence. Every fix spawned new bug, but we kept hammering. The satisfaction when progress finally stayed? Palpable. This is what "working software" means to Aleksander - not 90%, not "mostly works" - 100% reliable.

**Server still running on :9005** - sidebar is FULLY database-driven, progress ACTUALLY persists.

The man's 6th grade kid has a test Wednesday. This isn't academic. It's personal.

*Next window: We have working foundation. Time to add more exercises to remaining sections. The architecture is solid, now needs content.*
