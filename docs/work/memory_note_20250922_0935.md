## The Vibe
Aleksander is in **full execution mode** - no bullshit, straight to the point. Started the session with a runtime error that needed fixing ASAP. We crushed through database architecture analysis, made a decisive call to ditch Prisma for SQLite, and successfully migrated section 1.1. Zero fluff tolerance as always.

## What Just Happened
**The Great Database Migration** - We discovered Prisma was just test scaffolding while a fully-populated SQLite database (matma.db) was sitting there ready to rock. Made the executive decision to use the real thing.

### Critical Wins:
1. **Fixed runtime error** - Store was trying to access non-existent `section.exercises` array
2. **Database architecture decision** - Analyzed both Prisma and SQLite, chose SQLite (21 real exercises vs 1 test record)
3. **Section 1.1 migrated** - Now pulls from database, not hardcoded arrays
4. **better-sqlite3 working** - Solved the Next.js native module issue with `serverExternalPackages`

## The Dynamic
Aleksander style: "przeanalizuj obecna sytuacje" → immediate subtask delegation. He trusts but verifies EVERYTHING. When I said migration was done, immediate `curl` test. Found JSON parsing errors? Fixed on the spot with sqlite3 CLI. No explanations needed, just results.

## Technical State

### What's Working:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9005/api/exercises/1-1
# Returns 7 exercises from database with Polish content
```

### Database Structure:
- **matma.db** - 8 tables, hierarchical structure
- **Format**: I.1.1.1 (Roman division → chapter → section → exercise)
- **21 exercises** loaded across sections 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3

### Code Changes Made:
1. `/src/lib/db.ts` - better-sqlite3 connection
2. `/src/app/api/exercises/[sectionId]/route.ts` - API endpoint with `await params`
3. `/src/components/sections/number-line-section.tsx` - Dynamic data fetching
4. `next.config.js` - Added `serverExternalPackages: ['better-sqlite3']`

## Gotchas for Next You

### The JSON Trap:
MCP SQLite tool seems to have issues with UPDATE statements. Use direct sqlite3 CLI:
```bash
sqlite3 matma.db "INSERT INTO visual_configs VALUES (...)"
```

### Next.js 15 Changes:
```typescript
// OLD - breaks in Next.js 15
{ params }: { params: { sectionId: string } }

// NEW - required
{ params }: { params: Promise<{ sectionId: string }> }
const { sectionId } = await params;
```

### better-sqlite3 Fix:
```javascript
// next.config.js
serverExternalPackages: ['better-sqlite3'],  // NOT experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages
```

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Other sections need migration** - Only 1.1 done, need 1.2, 1.3, etc.
2. **Remove Prisma completely** - It's dead weight now
3. **Add section hints to database** - Currently returning empty array
4. **Test with the kid** - Wednesday test is coming!

## Aleksander Decoder Updates
- "ok" after analysis = proceed with implementation
- GitHub issue links = read and apply immediately
- "testowo zmigrujmy" = full production-ready migration expected

## The Energy
We're in that sweet spot where everything clicks. Database is real, data is Polish, structure makes sense. Aleksander's 6th grader has a test Wednesday - this isn't a toy project, it's mission-critical homework support. 

The app is **actually working** with real database now. No more hardcoded arrays. We proved the architecture works with section 1.1 - ready to scale to all sections.

**Server is running on :9005** - don't kill it, migrations in progress.

Next window: Jump straight into migrating remaining sections. No ceremony needed.
