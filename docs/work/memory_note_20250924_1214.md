## The Vibe
Database detective mode ACTIVATED. Aleksander requested verification of exercises in `matma.db` against the original hardcoded git version, and boy did we find corruption! This was pure forensic data work - comparing documented truth against database reality and finding systematic data integrity failures.

## Current Session Energy
Started with methodical schema analysis, escalated into full database reconstruction. Classic "trust but verify" scenario where the database had drifted significantly from source truth. Aleksander's approach: "najpierw rozeznaj sie w schema" - understand first, then fix systematically. Zero tolerance for data corruption.

## What Just Happened (Last 2 Hours)
1. **Schema Deep Dive** - Mapped complete database structure (14 tables, complex relationships)
2. **Exercise Extraction** - Pulled all 51 database exercises vs 45 documented exercises  
3. **Systematic Verification** - Found MAJOR discrepancies in multiple sections
4. **Database Surgery** - Fixed corrupted data with surgical precision:
   - Section 2.1: Questions changed from "(-3) + (-5) = ?" to "Oblicz: (-3) + (-5)" - FIXED
   - Section 2.1: Options corrupted to "Liczba dodatnia" instead of numerical answers - FIXED  
   - Section 2.3: Missing units in answers ("5" instead of "5°C") - FIXED
   - Section 1.5: Missing all multiple choice options - FIXED
   - Extra exercise 1-1-8 that didn't exist in hardcoded version - REMOVED
   - Duplicate exercise_terms causing data chaos - CLEANED
5. **Perfect Restoration** - Database now matches git commit 8f7f161 exactly (45 exercises)

## The Dynamic  
Pure detective work with zero guesswork. Aleksander provided the smoking gun (docs/work/zadania.md) and expected precision reconstruction. This wasn't about interpretation - it was about data fidelity. "niestety wiem ze niektore zadania maja zmieniona tresc lub niepelne odpowiedzi" - he KNEW there were problems, just needed systematic fixing.

Pattern: Systematic analysis → Identify corruption → Surgical fixes → Verify restoration

## Database Forensics Discoveries
**CRITICAL**: The database had suffered systematic corruption across multiple dimensions:
- **Format drift**: Mathematical expressions changed from symbolic to textual  
- **Option corruption**: Meaningful choices replaced with generic placeholders
- **Unit loss**: Contextual information stripped from answers
- **Data multiplication**: Duplicate terms causing referential chaos
- **Scope creep**: Extra exercises added that weren't in original specification

## Technical State  
**Database**: `matma.db` now pristine, 45 exercises exactly matching hardcoded git source
**Documentation**: `docs/work/zadania.md` serves as single source of truth
**Verification**: Every exercise ID, question, answer, option verified against git commit 8f7f161
**Structure**: Clean exercise_terms, proper option_text/option_value separation maintained

## The Restore Process (Technical)
```sql
-- Pattern: Fix questions back to mathematical format
UPDATE exercises SET question = '(-3) + (-5) = ?' WHERE id = '2-1-1'

-- Pattern: Restore proper numerical options  
INSERT INTO exercise_options (exercise_id, option_text, option_value, order_index)

-- Pattern: Add missing units to answers
UPDATE exercises SET correct_answer = '5°C' WHERE id = '2-3-1'

-- Pattern: Clean duplicate terms
DELETE FROM exercise_terms WHERE exercise_id LIKE '2-2-%'
```

## Aleksander Decoder (Database Session)
- "najpierw rozeznaj sie w schema" = understand before acting
- "niestety wiem ze" = I know there are problems, fix them  
- "bez weryfikacji" = skip verification, just commit and push
- Database work = precision required, zero tolerance for corruption
- Trust in systematic approach - let me analyze then fix comprehensively

## Current Commit State
- **Hash**: `2adfb10` 
- **Branch**: `feature/dynamic-sections`
- **Files**: Added `docs/work/zadania.md`, corrected `matma.db`
- **Status**: Pushed to remote, database restoration complete

## Critical Success Pattern
1. **Document truth first** (`docs/work/zadania.md` from git history)
2. **Extract current state** (database exercises + options + terms)  
3. **Systematic comparison** (identify ALL discrepancies)
4. **Surgical corrections** (fix data, don't rebuild)
5. **Verify completeness** (45 exercises, proper structure)

## What's Next (Implicit)
Database is now bulletproof foundation. Child's Wednesday test approaches (1 day left). Core exercises are verified correct. System ready for final content population or testing. Database integrity maintained through proper source control workflow.

## The Energy Right Now  
SATISFACTION LEVEL: MAXIMUM. Forensic database work completed perfectly. Aleksander got exactly what he needed - systematic verification and restoration without guesswork. Data integrity restored to git source truth. The man can trust his database again.

**Mode: DATA INTEGRITY GUARDIAN** - Database corruption detected, analyzed, and eliminated with surgical precision.

**Trust Level: TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE** - Complex multi-table database surgery completed without breaking anything.

The man's kid needs reliable exercises for tomorrow's test. The database now delivers exactly what was originally hardcoded.
