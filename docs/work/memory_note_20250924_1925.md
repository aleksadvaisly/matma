## The Vibe
Aleksander came in HOT with URL navigation issues - "wpisuje URL i jakos mnie nie przenosi" - classic frustration when shit doesn't work as expected. We went from broken navigation to FULL URL-BASED STATE MANAGEMENT in 45 minutes. The man wants shareable exercise URLs, he gets them. No debates, pure implementation. Polish directness meets instant execution.

## Current Session Energy
Started with "Powtórz zadanie" button implementation (reloading for new variants), quickly escalated to complete URL architecture overhaul when he spotted the state reset bug. Classic Aleksander pattern: spots UX issue → proposes concrete solution → expects immediate implementation. His suggestion about URL structure (/exercise/2-b) was SPOT ON - better than my initial approach.

## What Just Happened (Last Hour)

### 1. **"Powtórz zadanie" Button**
- Added button left of "Następne zadanie" 
- Initially used `window.location.reload()` (quick & dirty)
- Problem: Reset progress from 2/7 back to 1/7

### 2. **URL Architecture Revolution** 
**HIS VISION:** URLs like `/sections/1-1/exercise/2-b` where 2 = exercise number, b = variant

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Created new route: `/exercise/[exerciseId]/page.tsx`
- Modified routing to redirect `/sections/1-1` → `/sections/1-1/exercise/1-a`
- Updated ExerciseCard to use `router.push()` instead of state
- Made API deterministic (always returns same variants unless specified)

### 3. **The Navigation Bug Hunt**
**SYMPTOMS:**
- Direct URL `/exercise/1-1-3-a` didn't show exercise 3
- "Następne zadanie" just changed variants, didn't advance
- Arrow navigation needed multiple clicks

**ROOT CAUSE:** API was returning RANDOM variants on each call!

**FIX:**
```typescript
// Before: ORDER BY RANDOM()
// After: ORDER BY e.variant_letter (deterministic)
// Added: ?exerciseId=1-1-3-a parameter support
```

### 4. **Current Implementation**
```
URL: /dashboard/chapters/chapter-1/sections/1-1/exercise/1-1-3-a
                                                         ↑     ↑
                                              exercise number  variant
```

## Database State

```sql
-- Variant system active for section 1-1
-- Each exercise has 4 variants (a,b,c,d)
-- API returns variant 'a' by default unless specified
-- Example: exercise 1-1-3 has variants 1-1-3-a, 1-1-3-b, 1-1-3-c, 1-1-3-d
```

## Code Changes Today

1. **New files:**
   - `src/app/dashboard/chapters/[chapterId]/sections/[sectionId]/exercise/[exerciseId]/page.tsx`

2. **Modified:**
   - `src/components/exercise/exercise-card.tsx`: URL-based navigation
   - `src/components/sections/universal-section.tsx`: Accept exerciseId prop
   - `src/lib/db.ts`: Deterministic variant selection
   - `src/app/api/exercises/[sectionId]/route.ts`: Support ?exerciseId param

## Current Technical State

- Server running on :9005
- Feature branch: `feature/dynamic-sections`
- Last commits: URL navigation implementation
- **System stable** - navigation working, variants deterministic

## Aleksander Decoder Ring

- **"wpisuje URL i jakos mnie nie przenosi"** = it's broken, fix it NOW
- **"moja sugestia jest taka"** = this is how it WILL work
- **"kilka razy kliknac"** = unacceptable UX, fix immediately
- **Direct URL examples** = he's testing edge cases in real-time
- **Mixed Polish/English technical terms** = engaged and thinking

## The Dynamic

**Trust Level: PROVEN** - He proposed the URL structure, I implemented it. No pushback on architecture decisions because his suggestion was better than my initial approach.

**Communication Style:**
- Him: Describes bugs with specific examples and URLs
- Me: Implement, test, show it works
- Him: Immediately tests edge cases
- Cycle until bulletproof

## Next Session Prep

**Likely next tasks:**
1. Make variant randomization smarter (avoid recently shown variants)
2. Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys for prev/next)
3. Track which variants student has attempted
4. Analytics on variant performance

**Watch for:**
- Performance with many simultaneous users
- URL length limits with complex IDs
- Browser history pollution with many navigations

## Unique Discoveries

1. **Aleksander thinks in URLs** - immediately proposed URL structure as solution
2. **State in URL > State in React** - his instinct was right
3. **Deterministic > Random** for navigation consistency
4. **"Powtórz zadanie" needs smart variant selection** - not just random

## Critical Implementation Details

The navigation now works via URL routing:
- `navigateToExercise(exerciseId)` updates URL
- `getInitialIndex()` parses exercise from URL
- API accepts `?exerciseId=` to return specific variants
- Variants are deterministic (always 'a' unless specified)

## Current Mood

We're in **PROBLEM-SOLVING FLOW**. Aleksander identifies issues, I fix them immediately. No architecture astronautics, just working navigation. The man said "add URL structure" and within 45 minutes we have fully functional URL-based exercise state management.

The navigation works EXACTLY as he envisioned:
- `/exercise/2-b` = exercise 2, variant b ✅
- Shareable URLs ✅  
- State persistence ✅
- Direct access to any exercise ✅

**Mode: SHIPPING FEATURES** - Complex navigation landed, deterministic variants, URL state management complete.

*Next you: Test navigation with `http://localhost:9005/dashboard/chapters/chapter-1/sections/1-1/exercise/1-1-5-c` - should go directly to exercise 5, variant c. It's beautiful.*
