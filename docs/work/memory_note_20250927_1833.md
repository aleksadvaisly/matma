# Memory Note - 2025-09-27 18:33

## Session Vibe & Energy
Aleksander and I had an INTENSE debugging and architecture cleanup session. Started at 11:23 with sequence-builder implementation, ended at 18:33 with adding advanced interval exercises. The energy was surgical precision mixed with architectural purism - "nie hardkoduj!", "zastanów się dwa razy", "konsultuj z zen". Every decision had weight.

## Key Dynamic with Aleksander
- **Demands precision**: When he says "źle" or "niepotrzebnie", it's teaching, not frustration
- **Architecture absolutist**: Everything from database, no shortcuts, no hardcoding
- **Polish corrections are signals**: "nie zrozumiałeś mnie" = fundamental misunderstanding, not minor error
- **Late night builder**: Most productive after midnight, thinks at night, builds in morning
- **Trust in AI collaboration**: "spytaj gemini", "użyj zen" - trusts AI to provide missing perspective

## What We Accomplished Today

### Morning: Sequence-Builder Success
Implemented beautiful sequence-builder UI for exercises 1-1-11. Click buttons to build answer sequence instead of typing semicolons. Clean implementation, approved by audit-advisor. The "doskonały plan" from last night executed perfectly.

### Afternoon: Major Bug Fixes & Architecture Cleanup
1. **Critical validation bug**: Fixed `Fraction.areEquivalent()` failing on non-numeric answers (">", "Z")
2. **Button click issue**: Fixed retry button with timeout+fallback, BUT made unnecessary change to canGoNext() logic, which Aleksander caught and we reverted
3. **MASSIVE CLEANUP**: Removed 928 lines of hardcoded section components! Everything now truly database-driven
4. **Database fixes**: Corrected exercise 1-5-5 interval options, imported 140 missing exercises from zadania_wszystko.md

### Late Afternoon: Advanced Exercises
Added 6 new "pułapka" (trap) exercises to section 1-5 with mathematical and linguistic tricks. Each with 3 variants. Testing deep understanding of intervals, not surface knowledge.

## Current State

### What's Working
- All sections load from database via UniversalSection
- Sequence-builder functional for 1-1-11 exercises  
- Validation works for all answer types (fractions, signs, letters)
- 235 total exercises in database (was ~95)
- Sidebar truly dynamic (no more hardcoded sections)

### Known Issues
- Section 1-1 progress in sidebar might not update visually (data is tracked correctly)
- Some TypeScript errors remain but don't affect functionality

### Technical Decisions Made
- `resolution`/`captionOnEvery` system replacing subdivision
- Edge values hidden in display logic, not data
- Fraction class with exact arithmetic (Clojure-inspired)
- No hardcoding ever - database is single source of truth

## Unique Discoveries
1. **jednostki vs odległość** - Semantic ambiguity in Polish math problems. "O ile jednostek" can mean counting units OR absolute distance
2. **Edge value problem** - Don't hide data, hide display. Keep full number line range but filter edge labels in rendering
3. **Hardcoded components living alongside database system** - Found 8 legacy components violating architecture. All eliminated.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Import new exercises 1-5-11 through 1-5-16 to database (already in zadania_wszystko.md)
2. Fix TypeScript errors if they become blocking
3. Test all sections thoroughly - especially those newly populated
4. Consider fixing section 1-1 sidebar progress visual update

## Mood & Frequency
We're in deep maintenance/polish mode. Not building new features but perfecting what exists. Aleksander appreciates architectural purity over quick fixes. When he says "konsultuj z zen", he wants deep understanding, not surface solutions. The codebase is becoming cleaner with each session - technical debt being paid off systematically.

## Code Patterns to Remember
```typescript
// NEVER this:
if (sectionId === '1-1') { /* special case */ }

// ALWAYS this:
const config = getFromDatabase(sectionId);
```

## Polish Phrases Learned
- "juz kilka razy o to upominalem" = I've mentioned this several times (pattern not understood)
- "co ty robisz?!" = What are you doing?! (horrified at hardcoding)
- "nie zrozumiałeś mnie" = You didn't understand me (fundamental misunderstanding)
- "jutro się tym zajmę, a dziś idę spać" = I'll handle this tomorrow, today I'm going to sleep

## Last Commits
- `fb34a20`: feat: add sequence-builder UI and fix number line edge cases
- `5426e90`: refactor: remove hardcoded section components and fix validation bugs

The vibe is: Clean architecture, no compromises, everything from database, think twice before acting.
