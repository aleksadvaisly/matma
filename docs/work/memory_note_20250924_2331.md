## The Vibe
Aleksander in **ARCHITECT MODE** - we just built a COMPLETE 200+ exercise system from scattered sources. Man came with "w docs/scan masz zadania z matmy" and I delivered a full, database-ready exercise compendium. No half-measures. Full execution. The session shows his trust level: drops massive task, expects perfect delivery.

## Current Session Energy
Started with navigation bug ("ale czemu hardkodoujesz warianty?!") - immediate course correction to database-driven variants. Then straight into MASSIVE task: "zrob zestaw zadan" from scans + existing docs. No hesitation, pure building mode. Even commissioned agent verification ("zlec weryfikacje agentowi") - shows he trusts but verifies. Classic Aleksander.

## What Just Happened (Last 2 Hours)

### 1. **Fixed Arrow Navigation Variant Bug**
- Was hardcoding ['a','b','c','d'] - BAD
- Created `/api/exercises/variants/[baseId]` endpoint
- Now fetches actual variants from database
- Only section 1-1 has variants (for now)

### 2. **Database Review & Validation**
- Checked ALL exercises against original zadania.md
- Fixed exercise 1-1-4 variants (were wrong from migration)
- Verified sections 1-2 through 2-3 match perfectly

### 3. **MASSIVE Exercise Compilation**
Created `/docs/work/zadania_wszystko.md` with:
- 200+ exercises from original + scans
- 6 complete chapters
- Variants for section 1-1
- Full database schema mapping
- Difficulty levels 1-5
- Order indices for sequencing

### 4. **Agent Verification**
- Deployed debugging-advisor to verify math & structure
- Found ONE issue: confusing explanation in 5-3-1
- Fixed immediately
- Added complete database mapping section

## Database State

```sql
-- Exercises now properly structured
-- Section 1-1: 28 exercises (7 base × 4 variants)
-- Sections 1-2 to 2-3: Original exercises preserved
-- New sections ready for import from zadania_wszystko.md
-- Variant system uses exercise_base_id + variant_letter
```

## Code Changes Today

1. **API Enhancement:**
   - `/api/exercises/variants/[baseId]` - returns available variants
   
2. **Navigation Fixes:**
   - `getRandomVariant()` - fetches from DB not hardcoded
   - `refreshVariant()` - uses actual DB variants

3. **Documentation:**
   - `zadania_wszystko.md` - comprehensive exercise collection
   - Organized scans into batch1/, batch2/, batch3/

## Current Technical State

- Server running on :9005
- Feature branch: `feature/dynamic-sections`
- Last commits: exercise collection + database mapping
- **System ready** for bulk exercise import

## Aleksander Decoder Ring

- **"ale czemu hardkodoujesz warianty?!"** = fundamental architecture violation, fix NOW
- **"zlec weryfikacje agentowi"** = trust but verify pattern
- **"ok, popraw"** = no discussion needed, just do it
- **Quick task drops** = he's juggling multiple things, trusts me to handle
- **"bez weryfikacji"** = skip the ceremony, ship it

## The Dynamic

**Trust Level: ARCHITECTURAL** - He drops massive tasks expecting perfect execution. When I delivered 200+ properly structured exercises, he immediately had agent verify them. Found one issue, fixed it, done. No micromanagement.

**Communication Style:**
- Him: Drops huge requirements in Polish/English mix
- Me: Build comprehensive solution
- Him: Verify with agent
- Fix issues immediately
- Ship

## Next Session Prep

**Likely next tasks:**
1. Import zadania_wszystko.md into database
2. Add variants to more sections beyond 1-1
3. Build exercise generation/randomization system
4. Create difficulty-adaptive progression

**Watch for:**
- Performance with 200+ exercises
- Variant generation patterns
- Exercise progression logic
- Student performance tracking

## Unique Discoveries

1. **Aleksander thinks in SYSTEMS** - doesn't want one exercise, wants complete curriculum
2. **Agent verification pattern** - uses debugging-advisor to double-check my work
3. **Scans are goldmine** - textbook has WAY more exercises than original
4. **Database structure matters** - proper schema prevents future pain

## Critical Implementation Details

The exercise system now has:
- Complete markdown documentation with 200+ exercises
- Database schema mapping (input_type_id, difficulty_level, order_index)
- Variant system that works dynamically
- Organized source materials (scans in batches)

## Current Mood

We're in **FOUNDATION BUILDING**. Aleksander knows kid's test is coming, but he's thinking long-term. Not just fixing bugs - building complete educational system. The zadania_wszystko.md is like architectural blueprint - everything needed to build full math curriculum.

The man said "zrob zestaw zadan" at 22:00, by 23:30 we have:
- 200+ exercises ✅
- Database mapping ✅
- Agent verification ✅
- Fixed all issues ✅

**Mode: SYSTEM ARCHITECT** - Not just coding, building educational infrastructure. Kid's gonna ACE that test and every test after.

*Next you: Check if he wants to import zadania_wszystko.md to database. Script would need to parse markdown, generate IDs, handle variants, create options arrays. The structure is ready, just needs migration script.*
