# Debug Evidence Step 2: Added Debugging Logs

## DEBUGGING MODIFICATIONS MADE

### 1. ExerciseCard Component Debug Logs Added
**File:** `/Users/aleksander/Documents/projects/matma/src/components/exercise/exercise-card.tsx`

**Changes made:**
1. **Lines 115-122:** Added debug wrapper for `setSelectedAnswer` to log all value changes
2. **Lines 197-234:** Added extensive logging in `checkAnswer()` function to trace validation process

**Debug output will show:**
- When `setSelectedAnswer` is called (value, type, current exercise ID)  
- When `checkAnswer` is called (selectedAnswer, currentExercise.answer, types)
- FractionUtils.areEquivalent result
- String comparison fallback result
- Final validation result

### 2. Server Status
- Development server started successfully on http://localhost:9005
- Ready to test exercise 1-1-8-f with console logging

## NEXT STEPS FOR STEP 3
1. Navigate to exercise 1-1-8-f in browser
2. Open browser console to monitor debug logs
3. Click on 1.5 on the number line
4. Click "Sprawdź" button to check answer
5. Analyze console output to identify where the validation fails
6. Document specific evidence of the bug location

## HYPOTHESIS VERIFICATION PLAN
Expected console output sequence:
1. `setSelectedAnswer` called with value 1.5 (number)
2. `checkAnswer` called with selectedAnswer: 1.5, currentExercise.answer: "1.5"
3. `FractionUtils.areEquivalent result: true`
4. `FINAL correct result: true`

If this sequence occurs but user still sees "Jeszcze raz", the issue is elsewhere (likely in UI feedback display).
If selectedAnswer is null/undefined, the issue is in the data flow from NumberLine → UniversalAnswerInput → ExerciseCard.
